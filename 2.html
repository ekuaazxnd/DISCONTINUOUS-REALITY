    <div><h3>Ekua is a cursed participant in online identity. 'The other side of the curse is the blessing' is how Ekua describes the technological development of the Internet, and Ekua confronts current situation with the same attitude. Ekua explores the possibilities of the Internet's extended reality in her own particular capacity, combining post-humanism and cyborgs to create a performance art practice that explores how the existence and life of virtual identities can survive in the outside world from the internet perspective.</h3></div>

   <div> <h3>
        Mai Jiang is a media artist and photographer working with moving images, photography, computation, and new media. Her practice connects enquires about the nature of the photographic medium with recreation of geographically based senses and memories. Through her practice of reinterpreting and abstracting digital images, her intention aims to question the visibility and authenticity of photography through images. Mai brings inspiration from her journals and combines local landscape with stories, memories and personal experiences gathered from her journey. Her works are intent on visualizing moments in photography that disappear in memory over time from a private and quiet point of view. Mai has worked on the 'Discontinuous Reality' collaborated with artist Jingwen Liang with the purpose of exploring the limitless and development of new existentialism. Her work involves digital retouching, evoking memories of the twilight zone between representation and reality and show her research about the new landscape theory of stationary viewing behavior in high-speed moving vehicles.
